OS Version and Volume-related definitions
======================================================================================================
Not clear reason for choosing to put OS versions enum and a number of volume-related enums and a 
struct in this separate file. Might have to do with dependencies from the driver. Volume-related 
declarations seem to naturally fit to Volumes.h.
